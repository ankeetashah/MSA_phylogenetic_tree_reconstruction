This folder contains some intermediate file outputs for the project (some of which could not be properly printed in the actual file)

Contents of this folder:
1. MSA_Tree.pdf: a pdf version of the entire project 
2. sequence.gb: the C. elegans nucleotide sequence
3. protein.gb: the amino acid sequence of the first protein I looked at, F59B2.12, which was an uncharacterized protein in C. elegans (this was found from the first largest ORF)
4. protein2.gb: the amino acid sequence of the second second protein I look at, inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase epsilon subunit homolog 1. 
5. fiveproteins.txt: contains the amino acid sequences of the 5 hits picked from NCBI BLAST (with the headers p1-p5). 
6. fiveproteins copy.txt: the same as (5), but contains the actual names of the organisms the sequences belong to for reference. You can also find these in the report on page 7. 
7. MATLABTree.jpg: a picture file of the UPGMA tree generated in MATLAB
8. swalignHIGHEST.mat: the alignment of the highest score via the Smith-Waterman algorithm (an illegible version is on pages 10-12 in the actual pdf).
9. swalignLOWEST.mat: same as (8), but for the lowest score alignment.
10. clustalo-I20151211-115416-0951-18065353-pg(ClustalAlignmentWithoutNames).clustal: the CLUSTAL MSA file in the .clustal extension with p1-p5 identifiers
11. clustalo-I20151211-042053-0661-31612257-pg.txt: the txt version of (10) with the organism name as the identifier for reference 
12. nj.txt: the Neighbor-joining results from Clustal
13. njTree.jpg: the NJ tree (also shown on page 16 of the project file)
